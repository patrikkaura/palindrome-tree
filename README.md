# Palindrome tree

Palindrome tree tool is used for analyzing inverted repeats in various DNA/RNA sequences, including genome sequences, using decision trees. This tool takes provided sequences and finds interesting parts in which there's high probability of palindrome occurrence using decision tree. This process filters a big portion of data. Interesting data are then analyzed using API from [Palindrome Analyzer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006291X16314620).
